### Minor Changes

- 662ccc5: Finish the domain packages, verified with integration tests against Postgres, Redis, Typesense and MinIO, and contract suites shared by the real adapters and the test doubles. The Phase 6 packages move from alpha to beta.

  Breaking changes:

  - audit: `AuditQuery.find` and `findByResource` take `ctx` first; `RepositoryAuditQuery` no longer takes a context in its constructor. Reads are scoped to `ctx.tenantId`. The canonical hash form now sorts keys and includes `ipAddress` and `userAgent`, so chains written before this release don't verify.
  - notifications: `InAppNotificationStore.markRead(id, userId)` requires the recipient. `NotificationQueue.enqueue(ctx, name, data, { dedupKey })` matches `DefaultJobs.enqueue`. `DeliveryStore` keeps one row per notification and channel (`get`, `updateByExternalId`). Email template values are HTML-escaped; use `{{{name}}}` for raw HTML.
  - ai: `ai_sessions.id` and `ai_messages.session_id` are text, and `ai_messages` gains `position`. Unknown models cost 0 (with a warning) instead of `gpt-4o-mini` rates, and `costTable` merges over the defaults.
  - search: `SearchField.type` is a closed union (arrays allowed). `default_sorting_field` is only set from `SearchIndex.defaultSortingField`.
  - integrations: `IntegrationRegistry.register` throws when a listed function has no handler, or the integration is already registered.
  - rate-limit: an unknown explicit tier name throws `rate-limit/unknown-tier` instead of falling back to `default`. Fixed-window counters move to a hash (existing counters reset once).
  - core: new HTTP mappings for `rate-limit/backend-failed` (503), `rate-limit/unknown-tier` (500), `auth/unknown-role` (400), `storage/invalid-signature` (403), `search/missing-query-fields` (400), `integrations/invalid-signature` (401) and upstream AI and integration failures (502).

  Added: `DrizzleAuditLog` with a database-backed hash chain, `verifyChain`, retention and export; `DrizzleApiKeyStore`, `DrizzleRoleStore.defineRole` and DB-backed RBAC permissions; `AnthropicAdapter` (`@mariachi/ai/anthropic`) and cross-provider fallback for generate and stream; `ai.costTable`, `ai.fallbackModels` and `ai.anthropicApiKey` config; feature flag writes and tenant overrides; billing plan mirroring (`syncPlans`, `price.*` webhooks); `DefaultRateLimiting.consumeTier` and `resolveTier`; `notificationJobSchema`; `resolveTenantCredential(..., { fallbackToGlobal: false })`; `ctx.request.rawBody` in facade handlers for local signed-URL uploads.

  Fixed: concurrent auth webhook deliveries could both claim an event; API key rotation could leave a tenant without a key; notification retries multiplied between the queue and the service and duplicated deliveries; S3 `putStream` failed for streams of unknown length; Typesense index creation failed with a sort field, alias schemas were lost on restart, and reindexing leaked collections; string search filters weren't quoted; `reset` didn't clear fixed-window limits; token-bucket `retryAfterMs` reported the whole window; prompt versions sorted as strings.

- 662ccc5: Complete the domain packages: billing replay and automatic idempotency keys, notification dispatch, AI sessions with budgets and fallback, append-only audit chaining, database-backed RBAC and API key rotation, and the storage, search, rate-limit, and integration gaps.
