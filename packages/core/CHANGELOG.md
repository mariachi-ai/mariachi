# @mariachi/core

## 1.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 662ccc5: Harden the framework core: architecture, security, data, async, HTTP, CLI and docs.

  Breaking changes to migrate:

  - **Communication**
    - The call signature is now `communication.call(ctx, name, input)`, with `ctx` first.
    - Procedures register as `register(name, { schema: { input, output }, handler })`.
    - Duplicate names throw `communication/duplicate-procedure`.
    - Declare procedure types with `declare module '@mariachi/communication' { interface Procedures { ... } }`.
  - **Dependency injection**
    - Abstract services take an explicit `deps` or instrumentation object instead of reading the global container in their constructors.
    - Container keys are typed (`createKey<T>()`, `KEYS`).
  - **Config**
    - Importing `@mariachi/config` no longer loads `.env`. Pass `loadConfig({ dotenv: true })` or load it yourself.
    - Invalid config throws `ConfigError`.
  - **HTTP**
    - The api-facade stub auth strategies, the auth resolver and `createRouter` are removed. Use `bearerStrategy`, `apiKeyStrategy`, `serviceTokenStrategy` or `hmacSignatureStrategy`, or use `SignatureAuthController` for webhooks.
    - Controller routes declare Zod schemas and are prefixed automatically.
    - Health and OpenAPI routes live under the server prefix, for example `/api/health/ready`.
    - Errors use the JSON error envelope.
  - **Database**
    - A repository with a `tenantColumn` throws when `ctx.tenantId` is missing, unless the call goes through `crossTenant()`.
    - Database failures throw `DatabaseError`.
    - Migrations are generated from `defineTable` schemas with `mariachi db generate`.
  - **Jobs**
    - `enqueue` and `enqueueWithDedup` take `ctx` first. Job data travels in a context envelope.
    - `start()` prunes schedules that the current process didn't register.
  - **Events**
    - `traceId` and `tenantId` travel on the envelope, not in the payload.
    - For at-least-once delivery, use the Redis Streams adapter or the outbox.
  - **Encryption**
    - Ciphertexts use the new `mx1:` envelope, which records the key id and supports associated data.
    - Values written by earlier versions can't be read. Decrypt them with the old version and re-encrypt them.
  - **Tenancy**
    - The authenticated tenant is authoritative. A header that names another tenant throws `tenancy/mismatch`, which maps to HTTP 403.
  - **`@mariachi/create` and the CLI**
    - Generators target the `src/` project layout created by `mariachi init` and use the current APIs.
    - The generator API is `generateEntity`, `generateService`, `generateController`, `generateJob` and `generateIntegration`.
    - The Handlebars dependency is removed.
    - `mariachi validate` rules have new names (list them with `mariachi validate --list`).
  - **Docs**
    - The docs are consolidated in `@mariachi/core/docs`, and the `.mariachi/` copies are removed.
    - The package catalog is generated from `package.json` metadata.

- 662ccc5: Finish the domain packages, verified with integration tests against Postgres, Redis, Typesense and MinIO, and contract suites shared by the real adapters and the test doubles. The Phase 6 packages move from alpha to beta.

  Breaking changes:

  - audit: `AuditQuery.find` and `findByResource` take `ctx` first; `RepositoryAuditQuery` no longer takes a context in its constructor. Reads are scoped to `ctx.tenantId`. The canonical hash form now sorts keys and includes `ipAddress` and `userAgent`, so chains written before this release don't verify.
  - notifications: `InAppNotificationStore.markRead(id, userId)` requires the recipient. `NotificationQueue.enqueue(ctx, name, data, { dedupKey })` matches `DefaultJobs.enqueue`. `DeliveryStore` keeps one row per notification and channel (`get`, `updateByExternalId`). Email template values are HTML-escaped; use `{{{name}}}` for raw HTML.
  - ai: `ai_sessions.id` and `ai_messages.session_id` are text, and `ai_messages` gains `position`. Unknown models cost 0 (with a warning) instead of `gpt-4o-mini` rates, and `costTable` merges over the defaults.
  - search: `SearchField.type` is a closed union (arrays allowed). `default_sorting_field` is only set from `SearchIndex.defaultSortingField`.
  - integrations: `IntegrationRegistry.register` throws when a listed function has no handler, or the integration is already registered.
  - rate-limit: an unknown explicit tier name throws `rate-limit/unknown-tier` instead of falling back to `default`. Fixed-window counters move to a hash (existing counters reset once).
  - core: new HTTP mappings for `rate-limit/backend-failed` (503), `rate-limit/unknown-tier` (500), `auth/unknown-role` (400), `storage/invalid-signature` (403), `search/missing-query-fields` (400), `integrations/invalid-signature` (401) and upstream AI and integration failures (502).

  Added: `DrizzleAuditLog` with a database-backed hash chain, `verifyChain`, retention and export; `DrizzleApiKeyStore`, `DrizzleRoleStore.defineRole` and DB-backed RBAC permissions; `AnthropicAdapter` (`@mariachi/ai/anthropic`) and cross-provider fallback for generate and stream; `ai.costTable`, `ai.fallbackModels` and `ai.anthropicApiKey` config; feature flag writes and tenant overrides; billing plan mirroring (`syncPlans`, `price.*` webhooks); `DefaultRateLimiting.consumeTier` and `resolveTier`; `notificationJobSchema`; `resolveTenantCredential(..., { fallbackToGlobal: false })`; `ctx.request.rawBody` in facade handlers for local signed-URL uploads.

  Fixed: concurrent auth webhook deliveries could both claim an event; API key rotation could leave a tenant without a key; notification retries multiplied between the queue and the service and duplicated deliveries; S3 `putStream` failed for streams of unknown length; Typesense index creation failed with a sort field, alias schemas were lost on restart, and reindexing leaked collections; string search filters weren't quoted; `reset` didn't clear fixed-window limits; token-bucket `retryAfterMs` reported the whole window; prompt versions sorted as strings.
